## WORLDCOIN

- Track: [World ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id)

### Overview

Our platform leverages **Worldcoin's World ID** technology to ensure a human-centric and bot-resistant decentralized asset management environment. By integrating World ID, we aim to mitigate the risks of sybil attacks and ensure that every participant in our permissionless market is a verified human. This approach not only enhances the security of our platform but also aligns with our vision for the future of DeFi—where decentralized identities empower human-to-human interaction without governmental oversight.

### Why World ID?

- **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Central to maintaining the integrity of our permissionless market.
- **Human-Centric**: Guarantees real human interaction within our platform, enhancing trust and security.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Offers a non-governmental solution to identity verification, preserving user privacy and autonomy.

### Requirement for Strategy Creation

To participate in strategy creation on our platform, users are required to have a verified **World ID**. This ensures that each strategy is contributed by a unique individual, fostering a diverse and equitable trading environment.

### Concluding Thoughts

Integrating World ID is a crucial step towards our goal of creating a safer, more inclusive, and bot-resistant decentralized asset management platform. We believe that the future of DeFi must include robust solutions for identity verification, and World ID is poised to play a pivotal role in this evolution.

## Dynamic Integration: Simplifying DeFi/Web3 Interactions

- **Tracks**: Best crypto enabled app,  Integration magic  &&  Best onboarding UX

At Stratify, we believe the future of DeFi and Web3 lies in seamlessly abstracted interactions, where users can engage with digital assets and contracts without needing to understand the underlying complexities. To this end, we've integrated Dynamic's embedded wallets, setting a new standard for user-friendly crypto interactions.

### Driving Web3 Like a Car

Imagine driving a car. You don't need to know the intricacies of how the engine works, the specifics of the transmission, or the details of the suspension system to get from point A to point B. You simply get in, start the car, and drive. This is the level of simplicity and abstraction we aim for in the world of DeFi and Web3.

With Dynamic's embedded wallets, users can interact with our platform as easily as driving a car, without needing to understand the "mechanical" aspects of blockchain technology. This abstraction is crucial for bringing DeFi to the mainstream, aligning perfectly with Dynamic's value proposition of making crypto-native tools accessible to all.

### Integration Highlights

- **Embedded Wallets**: Seamlessly integrated within Stratify, offering a frictionless user experience.
- **Account Abstraction**: Users manage their digital assets without needing to grasp the technicalities of wallet management.
- **Access Control**: Enhanced security and user access management, ensuring a safe and trustable environment.
- **Simplified Onboarding**: Quick and intuitive user onboarding, bridging the gap for those new to the crypto space.

## Gnosis

- **Track**:  Yield Bearing Tokens Integration with Gnosis Pay

## Optimize Your Yield with Our Strategy/Vault on Gnosis

Forget holding pseudo fiat like EURe or GBPe. We've developed a strategy/vault that embraces the three highest-yield tokens available on Gnosis, providing you with an innovative approach to maximize your assets' growth:

- **Rocket Pool (rETH):** Access high yields with Rocket Pool's rETH on Gnosis at `0x2F0E755Efe6b58238A67DB420Ff3513Ec1fb31eF`.
- **Savings DAI (sDAI):** Benefit from Savings DAI's consistent returns on Gnosis at `0xaf204776c7245bF4147c2612BF6e5972Ee483701`.
- **Wrapped Liquid Staked Ether (wsETH):** Leverage the potential of wsETH on Gnosis at `0x6C76971f98945AE98dD7d4DFcA8711ebea946eA6`.

### Insta-Swap and Maximize Yield

Our platform not only allows you to hold the market's best yield tokens but also offers the flexibility to instantly swap them for any preferred token when using Gnosis Pay. The only catch? A delay module requires swap requests to be made 3 minutes before payment. This slight delay is a minor inconvenience when considering the ease of liquidity management—it's as simple as sending money via CashApp or Venmo. Now, you can have liquidity just in time for your transactions while maximizing the yield on your assets.
