- Track: [World ID](https://worldcoin.org/world-id)

### Overview

Our platform leverages **Worldcoin's World ID** technology to ensure a human-centric and bot-resistant decentralized asset management environment. By integrating World ID, we aim to mitigate the risks of sybil attacks and ensure that every participant in our permissionless market is a verified human. This approach not only enhances the security of our platform but also aligns with our vision for the future of DeFiâ€”where decentralized identities empower human-to-human interaction without governmental oversight.

### Why World ID?

- **Sybil Attack Prevention**: Central to maintaining the integrity of our permissionless market.
- **Human-Centric**: Guarantees real human interaction within our platform, enhancing trust and security.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Offers a non-governmental solution to identity verification, preserving user privacy and autonomy.

### Requirement for Strategy Creation

To participate in strategy creation on our platform, users are required to have a verified **World ID**. This ensures that each strategy is contributed by a unique individual, fostering a diverse and equitable trading environment.

### Concluding Thoughts

Integrating World ID is a crucial step towards our goal of creating a safer, more inclusive, and bot-resistant decentralized asset management platform. We believe that the future of DeFi must include robust solutions for identity verification, and World ID is poised to play a pivotal role in this evolution.
